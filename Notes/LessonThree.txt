if we use alignment in flutter than we don't use any column and children
- We use Alignment in Align widget
- gradient are also use in it.
```dart
gradient: LinearGradient(
              colors: [
                Colors.redAccent,
                Colors.yellowAccent,
              ],
            ),
```

-  If ypu use hex value of color so you follow the code given below `color: Color(0xff-yourhexcode-)
```dart
color: Color(0xff1d1f21),
```
- You can also style `Text` in flutter like this 

```dart
Center(
            child: Text(
              "BOX DECORATION",
              style: TextStyle(
                color: Colors.white,
              ),
            ),
          ),
```

- You can create avatar in two ways both are given below

```dart
CircleAvatar(
          radius: 50,
          backgroundImage: NetworkImage(
              'https://cdn.pixabay.com/photo/2018/03/21/16/50/woman-3247382__340.jpg'),
        ),
```

- in second way you need to create new folder called `assets` and download image in it.
- now goto `pupsec.yaml` file and and un comment the `assets: and the path of images`

### Stack
- `Stack` also have children after `rows` and `column`

` and we use `Positioned` widget in stack
```dart
Positioned(
            child: Container(
              margin: EdgeInsets.all(50),
              height: 100,
              width: 100,
              color: Colors.redAccent,
            ),
          ),
```

            ),
          ),
```
